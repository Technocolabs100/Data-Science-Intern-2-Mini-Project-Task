# Performing Logistic Regression with a New Feature and Creating a Precision-Recall Curve

In this Project, you'll train a logistic regression using a feature besides EDUCATION. Then you will graphically assess the tradeoff between precision and recall, as well as calculate the area underneath a precision-recall curve. You will also calculate the ROC AUC on both the training and testing sets and compare them.
