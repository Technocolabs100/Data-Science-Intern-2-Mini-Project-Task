# Exploring Remaining Financial Features in the Dataset

We will now examine the remaining financial features in a similar way to how we examined PAY_1, PAY_2, PAY_3, and so on. In order to better visualize some of these data, we'll use a mathematical function that should be familiar: the logarithm. You'll use pandas apply, which serves to apply any function to an entire column or DataFrame in the process.
